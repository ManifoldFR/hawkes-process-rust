# Rust implementation of Point processes

Point processes are used in seismology, social network analysis, and prediction of financial events.

This repository implements an algorithm to simulate point processes inside the [Rust programming language](https://rust-lang.org).

To run the examples, do for instance
```bash
cargo run --example variable_poisson
```

## Poisson point process



## Hawkes point process
